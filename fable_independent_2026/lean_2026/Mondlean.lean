  Mondlean — Lean 4 / mathlib formalization of the load-bearing MATHEMATICS behind the de Sitter–MOND
  F(Q)Θ completion (fable_independent_2026 lanes L77–L90; astra's F(Q)Θ construction).

  IMPORTANT SCOPE. Lean certifies *mathematical theorems*, not physical laws. What is machine-checked here
  is the internal mathematics the physics rests on — kernel identities, the health-sign dichotomy, the
  affine cuscuton degeneracy, the pressureless-dust / stiff-term density structure, and the MOND limits.
  Whether the theory is "a law of nature" is decided by the falsifiable predictions (dwarf σ–R_gc EFE,
  flat a₀(z), subdominant scalar GW) confronting DATA — not by Lean, and not while the intrinsic BBN
  fine-tuning (L84/L87) and astra's open ADM/khronon gates stand.

  Theorems (all: exit 0, zero `sorry`, axioms ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}):
    hasDerivAt_G, hasDerivAt_Gp   — Gp = dG/dy and Gpp = d²G/dy² proven (not merely asserted).
    kernel_identity               — MOND kernel G'(y)/(2y) = 1 − e^{-y}.
    Gpp_zero, Gpp_pos             — health dichotomy: G''(0)=0, G''(y)>0 ∀ y>0 (no ghost off zero field).
    cubic_leading                 — G(0)=G'(0)=G''(0)=0 ⇒ MOND term is cubic (drops from the linear action).
    affine_degeneracy             — cuscuton/det-W degeneracy K_QQ = 3F_Q²/(2M²) ⟺ 2M²K_QQ − 3F_Q² = 0.
    density_affine                — the FLRW density is B + 3M²H² − (M²/3f²)(A+C/a³)²: a Λ-const, an a⁻³
                                    DUST cross term, and an a⁻⁶ STIFF term (the L84/L87 structure).
    stiff_coeff_ne_zero           — the a⁻⁶ stiff coefficient −M²/(3f²) ≠ 0 for M,f ≠ 0 (fine-tuning intrinsic).
    sound_speed_zero              — c_s² = 0 (pressureless dust; the L82 clustering key).
    mu_deep_slope                 — deep-MOND: μ(η)=1−e^{-η} has slope 1 at η=0 (μ ≈ η).
    mu_newton_limit               — EFE/strong-field: μ(η) → 1 as η → ∞ (Newtonisation).
    mu_kernel_deriv(_pos)         — μ'(y)=e^{-y}>0 (kernel strictly monotone, the fact driving the obstruction).
    closure_obstruction           — L95: matching the generator forces A=1/μ ⇒ obstruction (1/2)AA' = −μ'/(2μ³).
    closure_needs_flat_kernel     — L95: obstruction = 0 ⟺ μ' = 0 (a flat, non-MOND kernel).
    cuscuton_forced               — L95 (necessity): exp kernel ⇒ μ'≠0 ⇒ obstruction ≠ 0 ⇒ p²-scalar can't
                                    close ⇒ the non-propagating (cuscuton) branch is forced.
    obstruction_coeff             — L105: the obstruction coefficient is (1/2)·A·A' in the p²-kinetic coeff A.
    cuscuton_obstruction_vanishes — L105 (sufficiency): a cuscuton has A ≡ 0 ⇒ obstruction (1/2)AA' = 0
                                    IDENTICALLY, for ANY kernel slope.
    cuscuton_closes_monotone      — L105: on the cuscuton branch obstruction = 0 AND μ' = e^{-y} > 0 coexist
                                    (impossible in the canonical case) — closure compatible with a monotone kernel.
    csSq_canonical, csSq_aqual    — L106: c_s²(n)=1/(2n−1); n=1 luminal (c_s²=1), n=3/2 AQUAL (c_s²=1/2, a
                                    competing cone that corrupts the structure function).
    cuscuton_denom_zero           — L106: n=1/2 makes 2n−1 = 0 ⇒ c_s² diverges (infinite, causal sound speed).
    cuscuton_unique_infinite      — L106: 2n−1 = 0 ⟺ n = 1/2 — the cuscuton is the UNIQUE power with no finite
                                    competing cone ⇒ the metric-sector structure function stays h^{ij}.
    canonical_scalar_dof          — Dirac count: a canonical scalar (phase dim 2, no constraints) has 1
                                    propagating dof (a wave).
    cuscuton_scalar_dof           — L108: a cuscuton scalar (phase dim 2, second-class pair) has 0 dof — the
                                    machine-checked DOF face of L104/L105/L106.
    cam_auxiliary_zero_dof        — L108: astra's CAM finite-k count (P=6, F=0, S=6) ⇒ (6−0−6)/2 = 0 dof
                                    (no propagating MOND scalar; the scalar-sector closure count).
    fully_constrained_zero_dof    — general: a fully second-class-constrained sector (S=P, F=0) has 0 dof.

/-! ### Positive closure theorem (L105): the cuscuton branch escapes the obstruction.

    The general p³ closure obstruction coefficient is (1/2)·A·A', where A is the p²-kinetic coefficient.
    Canonical case: closure forces A = 1/μ, giving −μ'/(2μ³) ≠ 0 (cuscuton_forced above). CUSCUTON case:
    there is NO p² kinetic term (A ≡ 0, the momentum is constrained), so the obstruction vanishes
    identically — for ANY kernel slope — while the kernel stays strictly monotone. Lean certifies the
    algebraic identity and the coexistence; the full HDA closure invokes Afshordi–Chung–Geshnizjani and is
    physics, not Lean. -/

/-- DECOUPLING / coexistence (the L105 sufficiency): on the cuscuton branch (A = 0) the obstruction is zero
    WHILE the MOND kernel stays strictly monotone (μ' = e^{-y} > 0). Closure and a genuine interpolating

/-! ### Sound-speed / structure-function theorem (L106): c_s²(n)=1/(2n−1); the cuscuton n=1/2 is the unique
    infinite-sound-speed power (no competing characteristic cone ⇒ the HDA structure function stays h^{ij}).
    Lean certifies the rational-function algebra of c_s²(n) and the uniqueness of the pole; the derivation
    c_s² = P_X/(P_X+2X P_XX) = 1/(2n−1) is in L106.py, and the structure-function principle is physics. -/

/-! ### Dirac degree-of-freedom counting (L108: closure at the DOF level, astra's CAM finite-k count).

    The physical configuration DOF of a constrained system is  dof = (P − 2·F − S)/2, where P is the phase-
    space dimension (2 × #fields), F the number of first-class and S the number of second-class constraints.
    Lean certifies the COUNTING; the constraint structure itself (that the CAM auxiliary sector has 6
    second-class constraints at finite k, PB rank 6) is astra's Dirac computation (cuscuton_acceleration_
    mond_2026), and the full covariant τ-clock algebra + PPN remain open. The cuscuton's zero-DOF result
