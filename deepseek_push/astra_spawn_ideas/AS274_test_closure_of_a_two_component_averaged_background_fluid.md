# AS274 — Test closure of a two-component averaged background fluid

**Group:** A11 — Homogeneous cosmology and global modes  
**Priority:** P0 · **Kind:** construction · **Execution state:** proposed; not dispatched  
**Branch:** CA5-GNC-R homogeneous candidate  
**Explicit prerequisites:** AS255

## Assignment and principle

Phenomenological transfer rates are admissible only after a controlled reduction of the coherent fields.

Perform this one work order. Your result may support a scoped claim, expose a counterexample, or identify an exact unresolved implication. The requested result is not predetermined.

## Framework base — mandatory in this calculation

Use Zimmerman’s `a0=(c/2)*sqrt(G*rho_Lambda)` with mass-density `rho_Lambda`, `r_M=sqrt(G*M_b/a0)` and deep `v_flat^4=G*M_b*a0`. Treat `kappa=1/2` as adopted unless this task supplies an independent derivation. Dimensional examples must carry canonical `9.3619e-11` and alternative `1.1279e-10 m/s^2` separately; they cannot share both fixed vacuum density and fixed kappa. A purely dimensionless result must state how both footings apply.

Read [FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md](FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md) before computing. Q (`g^2=B^2+a0*B`), RAR (`nu=1/(1-exp(-sqrt(B/a0)))`), MU2 (`mu=1-(1+g/(2*a0))^-2`), historical EXP AQUAL, and operative filtered MONO are distinct. Use only this task’s declared branch for conclusions. The amended thirteen-item target uses filtered MONO and causality criterion B. Any historical branch is a comparison or conditional lemma until an explicit bridge to that target is proved.

## Mathematics and principal test

```text
Define averaged energies rho_P and rho_Cs and Q_E by rho_P_dot+3H(rho_P+p_P)=-Q_E; total energy conservation fixes the opposite source.
```

## Inputs, domain and first bound

Weak mixing and separated oscillation/Hubble times; one finite background resonance passage; no random-phase assumption unless explicitly introduced. Keep the exactly homogeneous sector separate from every nonzero Fourier constraint. Carrier masses, initial charge, V0 and host coefficients remain inputs; this task must not promote an allowed cosmological branch into a prediction of abundance.

## First-principles obligation

Start from the declared CA5-GNC-R homogeneous candidate equations and inspect the source premises for Test closure of a two-component averaged background fluid. Derive the stated mathematical object from those premises, listing every independent coefficient, boundary condition and measured input. Phenomenological transfer rates are admissible only after a controlled reduction of the coherent fields. The adopted one-half normalization is not a derived result unless an independent argument removes its freedom.

## Contribution to common-theory closure

Supply the precise implication represented by Test closure of a two-component averaged background fluid to a single common-action closure witness. A valid closure or explicit phase-memory obstruction identifies what a cosmological fluid implementation must retain. Report scoped success, a concrete failed condition, or the exact missing input; none of these outcomes alone closes the thirteen requirements. Identify the affected operative gate and prove any branch-translation or reduction used before transferring the result.

## Execute in order

1. Derive the exact component energy exchange from the five-field equations.
2. Average over a declared time window and determine whether Q_E depends only on densities or also on relative phases.
3. Construct two equal-density states with different phases and compare the predicted exchange to test Markovian density closure.
4. Write the requested relation or counterexample with every assumption used, then identify the single downstream calculation that it enables or blocks. Keep numerical evidence bounded by the stated domain.

## Controls that must be capable of failing

- Zero coupling must give identically zero exchange.
- Negative control: force Q_E=Gamma rho_P with phase-independent Gamma and test both equal-density phase states.

## Completion criterion

A valid closure or explicit phase-memory obstruction identifies what a cosmological fluid implementation must retain. Report scoped success, a concrete failed condition, or the exact missing input; none of these outcomes alone closes the thirteen requirements.

## Authorized continuation and branching

Read [FIRST_PRINCIPLES_AND_BRANCHING.md](FIRST_PRINCIPLES_AND_BRANCHING.md). This seed is an entry point: pursue a promising derivation to completion, open distinct child work orders when needed, and submit a complete first-principles closure candidate if the evidence supports one. Check the live manifest, results and other campaign queue before dispatching a child. A renamed calculation, another parameter sample or a second review is not a new scientific task. Do not claim a child ran unless an actual worker executed it.

1. If the main result survives its controls, strengthen Test closure of a two-component averaged background fluid by removing its weakest explicitly named independent premise or extending its quantified domain. State the new target equation and why the existing result does not already answer it.
2. If the result supplies a missing response or bound, derive its consequence for the nearest unresolved same-action gate. Use the actual formula and its error/domain limits from this result; identify the gate and a distinct observable or theorem before dispatch.
3. If a counterexample or obstruction appears, isolate the smallest failed implication in Test closure of a two-component averaged background fluid. Construct a target-native repair or no-go proof, preserving the counterexample and rechecking all assumptions changed by the repair.

Record each child’s exact new claim, source/result hashes, parent, dependency, controls and first-principles bridge. If the runner cannot spawn, write a ready child specification for the orchestrator and continue independent derivation within the current task.

## Return package and stop rule

Write primary evidence to `deepseek_push/astra_spawn_ideas/results/AS274/<unique_run_id>/`; child specifications and claims use the authorized paths in the branching protocol. Return `derivation.md`, runnable code and raw outputs if used, and `result.json` following [RESULT_CONTRACT.json](RESULT_CONTRACT.json). Record the actual model/worker identity, commands, source and data hashes, assumptions, branch/action/gate/parameter cell, units, tested domain, residuals, controls and limitations. A proof-only result must not invent computational evidence.

Start with the cheapest bounded discriminating calculation. Use a symbolic identity or <=120-second prototype before a larger computation; record actually enforced bounds. If the next step needs missing data, an unproved prerequisite or an unspecified physical mechanism, stop that implication and return its exact statement plus valid independent progress. Do not substitute a new law or invented observations. Numerical agreement is finite evidence; synthetic agreement is not an empirical test; a task completion is not closure of gravity.
