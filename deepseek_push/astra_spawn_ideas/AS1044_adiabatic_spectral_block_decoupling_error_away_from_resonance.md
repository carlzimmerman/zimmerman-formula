## Assignment and principle

Quantify when an entire gapped physical-mode block evolves approximately independently, without computing an avoided-crossing transfer matrix.

Perform this one work order. Your result may support a scoped claim, expose a counterexample, or identify an exact unresolved implication. The requested result is not predetermined.

## Framework base — mandatory in this calculation

Use Zimmerman’s `a0=(c/2)*sqrt(G*rho_Lambda)` with mass-density `rho_Lambda`, `r_M=sqrt(G*M_b/a0)` and deep `v_flat^4=G*M_b*a0`. Treat `kappa=1/2` as adopted unless this task supplies an independent derivation. Dimensional examples must carry canonical `9.3619e-11` and alternative `1.1279e-10 m/s^2` separately; they cannot share both fixed vacuum density and fixed kappa. A purely dimensionless result must state how both footings apply.

Read [FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md](FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md) before computing. Q (`g^2=B^2+a0*B`), RAR (`nu=1/(1-exp(-sqrt(B/a0)))`), MU2 (`mu=1-(1+g/(2*a0))^-2`), historical EXP AQUAL, and operative filtered MONO are distinct. Use only this task’s declared branch for conclusions. The amended thirteen-item target uses filtered MONO and causality criterion B. Any historical branch is a comparison or conditional lemma until an explicit bridge to that target is proved.

## Mathematics and principal test

```text
Let P(tau) be a spectral projector onto a physical block separated by gap g(tau)>=g_min>0, and T(tau,s) the exact propagator. Bound norm((I-P(tau)) T(tau,s) P(s)) in the physical kinetic norm using projector derivatives and the gap.
```

## Inputs, domain and first bound

One finite interval and a spectrally isolated block that may contain internal degeneracies; exclude crossings with its complement explicitly. One smooth admissible background and a declared finite momentum band; retain canonical normalization and all constrained exchange terms. Zero field and the MONO splice require separate regularity hypotheses.

## First-principles obligation

Use the already derived quadratic reduction and vertices of the same CA5 action. Background amplitudes, couplings and momentum cutoffs remain inputs; no phenomenological damping may be inserted.

## Contribution to common-theory closure

A controlled block-decoupling error justifies reduced perturbation systems used in later cosmological calculations; crossing dynamics remains a distinct task.

## Execute in order

1. Construct P from the validated physical operator, treating a degenerate block as a subspace rather than choosing unstable individual eigenvectors.
2. Derive the off-block connection terms from the changing projector and kinetic normalization.
3. Prove a finite-interval leakage bound with stated derivative and gap constants, retaining endpoint preparation error.
4. Compare with a direct small-system propagator while remaining inside the gapped domain; do not extrapolate the bound through a closing gap.

## Controls that must be capable of failing

- Constant projectors with exactly decoupled blocks must give zero leakage.
- Negative control: drive g_min to zero while retaining the same advertised bound and expose its lost hypothesis.

## Completion criterion

Deliver the requested relation with its domain, or a concrete obstruction and the failed estimate. Keep finite verification separate from a general proof.

## Authorized continuation and branching

Read [FIRST_PRINCIPLES_AND_BRANCHING.md](FIRST_PRINCIPLES_AND_BRANCHING.md). This seed is an entry point: pursue a promising derivation to completion, open distinct child work orders when needed, and submit a complete first-principles closure candidate if the evidence supports one. Check the live manifest, results and other campaign queue before dispatching a child. A renamed calculation, another parameter sample or a second review is not a new scientific task. Do not claim a child ran unless an actual worker executed it.

1. If promising: Can the bound justify dropping a specified entropy block over a cosmological interval?
2. If promising: Does the subspace formulation stay regular when eigenvalues cross inside the isolated block?
3. If failed: Retain the coupled complementary block when the gap or derivative bound fails.

Record each child’s exact new claim, source/result hashes, parent, dependency, controls and first-principles bridge. If the runner cannot spawn, write a ready child specification for the orchestrator and continue independent derivation within the current task.

## Return package and stop rule

Write primary evidence to `deepseek_push/astra_spawn_ideas/results/AS1044/<unique_run_id>/`; child specifications and claims use the authorized paths in the branching protocol. Return `derivation.md`, runnable code and raw outputs if used, and `result.json` following [RESULT_CONTRACT.json](RESULT_CONTRACT.json). Record the actual model/worker identity, commands, source and data hashes, assumptions, branch/action/gate/parameter cell, units, tested domain, residuals, controls and limitations. A proof-only result must not invent computational evidence.

Start with the cheapest bounded discriminating calculation. Use a symbolic identity or <=120-second prototype before a larger computation; record actually enforced bounds. If the next step needs missing data, an unproved prerequisite or an unspecified physical mechanism, stop that implication and return its exact statement plus valid independent progress. Do not substitute a new law or invented observations. Numerical agreement is finite evidence; synthetic agreement is not an empirical test; a task completion is not closure of gravity.
