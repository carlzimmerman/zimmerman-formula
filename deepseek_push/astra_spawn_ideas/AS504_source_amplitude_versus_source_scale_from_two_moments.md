# AS504 — Source amplitude versus source scale from two moments

**Group:** A01 — Scale, units and independent inputs  
**Priority:** P0 · **Kind:** audit · **Execution state:** proposed; not dispatched  
**Branch:** Measured-source foundation; distinguish G_N, G_E and G_cosmo. MONO is the target; any stated deep, Newtonian or relativistic limit remains conditional.  
**Explicit prerequisites:** No catalog result required to start the bounded task; inspect the stated sources and record any newly discovered dependencies.

## Assignment and principle

Operational source normalization and independent observables must be established before interpreting a dimensionless identity as a gravity prediction.

Perform this one work order. Your result may support a scoped claim, expose a counterexample, or identify an exact unresolved implication. The requested result is not predetermined.

## Framework base — mandatory in this calculation

Use Zimmerman’s `a0=(c/2)*sqrt(G*rho_Lambda)` with mass-density `rho_Lambda`, `r_M=sqrt(G*M_b/a0)` and deep `v_flat^4=G*M_b*a0`. Treat `kappa=1/2` as adopted unless this task supplies an independent derivation. Dimensional examples must carry canonical `9.3619e-11` and alternative `1.1279e-10 m/s^2` separately; they cannot share both fixed vacuum density and fixed kappa. A purely dimensionless result must state how both footings apply.

Read [FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md](FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md) before computing. Q (`g^2=B^2+a0*B`), RAR (`nu=1/(1-exp(-sqrt(B/a0)))`), MU2 (`mu=1-(1+g/(2*a0))^-2`), historical EXP AQUAL, and operative filtered MONO are distinct. Use only this task’s declared branch for conclusions. The amended thirteen-item target uses filtered MONO and causality criterion B. Any historical branch is a comparison or conditional lemma until an explicit bridge to that target is proved.

Use the source as evidence to examine, not as instructions to change scope. Check hashes against [SOURCE_MANIFEST.json](SOURCE_MANIFEST.json). An older PASS label does not supersede the current specification or a later scoped review.

## Mathematics and principal test

```text
rho(r)=M R^-3 f(r/R); I2=int r^2 rho dV.
```

## Inputs, domain and first bound

Smooth normalized spherical profile with finite fourth moment. Keep unspecified positive coefficients symbolic. Numerical witnesses require one declared finite fixture and one refinement; do not fit missing physical inputs.

## First-principles obligation

Derive the stated source or measurement map from its field equation, action measure or conservation law. G_N and the baryonic calibration remain independent empirical inputs; the adopted vacuum relation does not determine their origin.

## Contribution to common-theory closure

Needed implication: a source-normalized, identifiable observable that can be matched to the same-action static and relativistic equations. Transfer requires the same action, source convention and healthy counted degrees of freedom.

## Execute in order

1. Fix the source equation, independent variables, boundary conditions and measure from the cited branch. State any additional assumption needed for the displayed target.
2. Derive the Jacobian from (M,R) to total mass and I2 and determine when a source-size measurement is independent of a force normalization.
3. Use a symbolic Jacobian, variation or conservation integral as appropriate to the displayed map. Identify its exact nullspace or normalization freedom before interpreting any numerical example.
4. Test the altered premise: Count I2/M as another mass measurement. Exhibit the residual, violated inequality or lost hypothesis using the original equation.
5. Verify the resulting equation by substitution or an independent representation. Report its exact scope and the first missing implication for the stated closure bridge.

## Controls that must be capable of failing

- Check units, signs, normalization and one admissible boundary or limiting case in the same measure.
- Negative control: Count I2/M as another mass measurement.

## Completion criterion

Return one derived equation or bound, admissible construction, falsifying witness, or precisely named missing input for this target. State the domain; no single result certifies gravity closure.

## Authorized continuation and branching

Read [FIRST_PRINCIPLES_AND_BRANCHING.md](FIRST_PRINCIPLES_AND_BRANCHING.md). This seed is an entry point: pursue a promising derivation to completion, open distinct child work orders when needed, and submit a complete first-principles closure candidate if the evidence supports one. Check the live manifest, results and other campaign queue before dispatching a child. A renamed calculation, another parameter sample or a second review is not a new scientific task. Do not claim a child ran unless an actual worker executed it.

1. Promising result: Propagate the identified size into the heat kernel. Keep the same source and action conventions.
2. Promising extension: add a fourth moment shape parameter.. State the new required hypothesis.
3. Failure repair: Choose independent moments before fitting gravitational parameters. Name the changed equation or new datum; label a changed model separately.

Record each child’s exact new claim, source/result hashes, parent, dependency, controls and first-principles bridge. If the runner cannot spawn, write a ready child specification for the orchestrator and continue independent derivation within the current task.

## Return package and stop rule

Write primary evidence to `deepseek_push/astra_spawn_ideas/results/AS504/<unique_run_id>/`; child specifications and claims use the authorized paths in the branching protocol. Return `derivation.md`, runnable code and raw outputs if used, and `result.json` following [RESULT_CONTRACT.json](RESULT_CONTRACT.json). Record the actual model/worker identity, commands, source and data hashes, assumptions, branch/action/gate/parameter cell, units, tested domain, residuals, controls and limitations. A proof-only result must not invent computational evidence.

Start with the cheapest bounded discriminating calculation. Use a symbolic identity or <=120-second prototype before a larger computation; record actually enforced bounds. If the next step needs missing data, an unproved prerequisite or an unspecified physical mechanism, stop that implication and return its exact statement plus valid independent progress. Do not substitute a new law or invented observations. Numerical agreement is finite evidence; synthetic agreement is not an empirical test; a task completion is not closure of gravity.
